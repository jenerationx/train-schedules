# train-schedules

In this assignment, I got to reminisce about my trip to Paris a few years ago.  Their metro system was the best I've ever seen and I loved taking the trains from one beautiful location to the next.

Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler

Overview

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
